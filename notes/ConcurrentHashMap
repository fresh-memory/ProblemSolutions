ConcurrentHashMap performs better than SynchronizedMap, HashTable,HashMap. It does not guarantee same view for all threads. It is ideal for written intensive, light read scenario. 
SynchronizedMap locks entire table but guarantee same view for all threads. 
HashTable is old implementation. need to lock entire table causing performance degradation. 
HashMap is not thread safe but allow either key or value is null.
