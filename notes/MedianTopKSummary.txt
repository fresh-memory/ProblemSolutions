1. Find median of two sorted array
2. Find kth element of two sorted array

A[0.....i.....m-1]
B[0.....j.......n-1]

if(i is the kth element of the two arrays) => A[i] > (k-1) number of elements and A is sorted A[i] is bigger than A[0...i-1]
=> A is bigger than k-1-i elements in B=>j=k-i-2 

So the invariant here is B[j+1]>A[i]>B[j]  <=> A[i] is the kth element of the two

Recursively shrink the total size of two arrays so Run time O(log(m+n))

Like binary search, need to use Helper Function with _left_ and _right_ pointer to decide the value of i and further decide
the value of j. i is the index for A, (prefferd the shorter array) and j is the index for B. 


A lot of special cases to handle, e.g., even/odd number of total elements, one of them is empty, one is totally smaller than the other one.
