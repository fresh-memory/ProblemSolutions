DP 


Two Dimensional DP
for(int i=0;i<length-1;i++)}{


1. Parser tree -- add parenthesis to maximize overall value
2. break strings to words
3. matrix multiplication fewest operation



Bottom up recursive is easier to be  transformed to tabuealar DP
(Top down recursive need to utilize memorizaiton to avoid repeptive computin)g
