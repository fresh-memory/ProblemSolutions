TOP K stats

Many algos.

No negative update: only add not substracting

Frequenty: build a K heap storing<element, count>, if a new item is not in heap, the count of every element in heap -1.
When the MIN count in  the heap is 0, the corresponing element need to be removed.

SpaceSaving: build a K heap storing <element, count>, if a new item is not found in heap, replace the element with the min count with the new item and increment the min_count by 1. a short proof demonstrates that the
counts of all stored items solve the frequency estimation problem
with error n/k.......
